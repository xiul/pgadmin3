  <h3>pgAgent Schedules</h3>

  <p>Each Job is executed according to one or more schedules. Each time the
  job or any of its schedules are altered, the next runtime of the job is
  re-calculated. Each instance of pgAgent periodically polls the database for
  jobs with the next runtime value in the past. By polling at least once
  every minute, all jobs will normally start within one minute of the
  specified start time. If no pgAgent instance is running at the next runtime
  of a job, it will run as soon as pgAgent is next started, following which
  it will return to the normal schedule.</p>

  <p>Schedules may be added to a job through the job properties dialogue, or
  added as a sub-object. The <i>Properties</i> tab of the main pgAdmin window
  will display details of the selected schedule.</p>

  <p>Each schedule consists of the basic details such as a name, whether or
  not it is enable and a comment. In addition, a start date and time is
  specified (before which the schedule has no effect), and optionally an end
  date and time (after which the schedule has no effect).</p>

  <p>Schedules are specified using a cron-style format. For each selected
  time or date element, the schedule will execute. For example, to execute at
  5 minutes past every hour, simply tick '5' in the <i>Minutes</i> list box.
  Values from more than one field may be specified in order to further
  control the schedule. For example, to execute at 12:05 and 14:05 every
  Monday and Thursday, you would tick minute 5, hours 12 and 14, and weekdays
  Monday and Thursday. For additional flexibility, the <i>Month Days</i>
  check list includes an extra <i>Last Day</i> option. This matches the last
  day of the month, whether it happens to be the 28th, 29th, 30th or
  31st.</p>

  <p>On occasion it may be desirable to specify an exception for a schedule -
  for example, you may not want a schedule to fire on a particular national
  holiday. To achieve this, each schedule may have a list of date and/or time
  exceptions attached to it. If a schedule lands on an exception, that
  instance will be skipped, and the following occurance will become the next
  runtime.</p>
