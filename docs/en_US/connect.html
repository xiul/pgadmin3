  <h3>Connect to Server</h3>

  <center>
    <img src="images/server.png">
  </center>

  <p>Use this dialog to add a new server connection to the pgAdmin tree.</p>

  <p>If you're experiencing connection problems, check the <a href=
  "connect-error.html">connection problems</a> page.</p>

  <p>The name is a text to identify the server in the pgAdmin tree.</p>

  <p>The host is the IP address of the machine to contact, or the fully
  qualified domain name. On Unix based systems, the address field may be left
  blank to use the default PostgreSQL Unix Domain Socket on the local
  machine, or be set to an alternate path containing a PostgreSQL socket. If
  a path is entered, it must begin with a "/". The port number may also be
  specified.</p>

  <p>The service field is the name of a service configured in the
  pg_service.conf file. For details, see the <a href=
  "http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/interactive/libpq-pgservice.html">pg_service
  documentation</a>.</p>

  <p>The maintenance DB field is used to specify the initial database that
  pgAdmin connects to, and that will be expected to have the <a href=
  "pgagent.html">pgAgent</a> schema and <a href="extend.html">adminpack</a>
  objects installed (both optional). On PostgreSQL 8.1 and above, the
  maintenance DB is normally called 'postgres', and on earlier versions
  'template1' is often used, though it is preferrable to create a 'postgres'
  database for this purpose to avoid cluttering the template database.</p>

  <p>If you select "Store password", pgAdmin stores passwords you enter in
  the ~/.pgpass file under *nix or %APPDATA%\postgresql\pgpass.conf under
  Win32 for later reuse. For details, see <a href=
  "http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/libpq-pgpass.html&quot;">
  pgpass documentation</a>. It will be used for all libpq based tools. If you
  want the password removed, you can select the server's properties and
  uncheck the selection any time.</p>

  <p>The colour field allows you to set a specific colour for this server.
  This colour will be used in the background of the tree where each object of
  this server is displayed.</p>

  <p>The Group field is used to push your server in a specific group. You can
  have a production group, and a test group. Or LAN specific groups. It's
  completely up to you. But it helps when you have lors of server to
  register.</p>

  <p>The second tab has all the SSL specific options: what kind of SSL
  connection you want, your root certificate file, your server CRL, your
  client certificate file, and finally your client key file.</p>

  <p>The third tab contains some advanced options that are seldomly used.</p>

  <p>The "Connect now?" field makes pgAdmin attempt a connection as soon as
  you hit the OK button.</p>

  <p>You can unckeck the "Connect now" checkbox if you don't want the
  connection to the server being established immediately, but only registered
  for later use. In this case, the connection parameters won't be
  validated.</p>

  <p>The "Restore env?" option determines whether or not pgAdmin will attempt
  to restore the browser environment when you reconnect to this server. If
  you regularly use different databases on the same server you might want to
  turn this option off.</p>

  <p>The Rolename field allows you to connect as a role, and then get the
  permissions of another one (the one you specified in this field). The
  connection role must be a member of the rolename.</p>

  <p>The DB restriction field allows you to enter an SQL restriction that
  will be used against the <a href=
  "http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/catalog-pg-database.html">
  pg_database</a> table to limit the databases that you see. For example, you
  might enter: <i>'live_db', 'test_db'</i> so that only live_db and test_db
  are shown in the pgAdmin browser. Note that you can also limit the schemas
  shown in the database from the Database properties dialogue by entering a
  restriction against <a href=
  "http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/catalog-pg-namespace.html">
  pg_namespace</a>.</p>

  <p>The "Service ID" field specifies parameters to control the database
  service process. Its meaning is operating system dependent.</p>

  <p>If pgAdmin is running on a Windows machine, it can control the
  postmaster service if you have enough access rights. Enter the name of the
  service. In case of a remote server, it must be prepended by the machine
  name (e.g. PSE1\pgsql-8.0). pgAdmin will automatically discover services
  running on your local machine.</p>

  <p>If pgAdmin is running on a Unix machine, it can control processes
  running on the local machine if you have enough access rights. Enter a full
  path and needed options to access the pg_ctl program. When executing
  service control functions, pgAdmin will append status/start/stop keywords
  to this. Example:<br>
  sudo /usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl -D /data/pgsql</p>

  <p>This dialog can be launched at a later time to correct or add parameters
  by executing "properties" when the server is selected. You should not be
  connected to it if you want to make changes on its properties.</p>
