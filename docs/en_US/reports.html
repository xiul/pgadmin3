  <h3>Report Tool</h3>

  <p>pgAdmin includes a simple reporting engine which allows you to quickly
  generate reports from the queries you write in the <a href=
  "query.html">Query Tool</a>, or from objects or collections of objects in
  the main application Window - for example, you can create a report of the
  properties of any object, or a list of functions in a schema. To create a
  report, select a node in the browser treeview, and select the report to
  create from the context menu, or from the Reports submenu of the Tools
  menu. To create a report in the Query Tool, select the Quick Report option
  from the File menu.</p>

  <p>Each report contains a title and optional notes that can be modified
  before the report is produced. In addition, you may select whether or not
  to include any SQL that may be relevant to the report you have
  selected.</p>

  <p>Reports are generated internally in XML, however pgAdmin can apply an
  XML stylesheet to the report at processing time to format the output as
  required. A default stylesheet is built-in which produces HTML output. With
  the HTML output option selected, you can opt to embed the default CSS
  stylesheet (which will render the report in the same colors as the pgAdmin
  website), to embed an external stylesheet into the report, or to link to an
  external stylesheet. The following class/object ID's are used:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>#ReportHeader</b>: This div contains the report header.</li>

    <li><b>#ReportNotes</b>: This div contains the option report notes.</li>

    <li><b>#ReportDetails</b>: This div contains the main body of the
    report.</li>

    <li><b>#ReportFooter</b>: This div contains the report footer.</li>

    <li><b>.ReportSQL</b>: This class is used by the &lt;PRE&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;
    blocks containing SQL.</li>

    <li><b>.ReportDetailsOddDataRow</b>: This class is applied to the odd
    numbered rows of tables.</li>

    <li><b>.ReportDetailsEvenDataRow</b>: This class is applied to the even
    numbered rows of tables.</li>

    <li><b>.ReportTableHeaderCell</b>: This class is applied to table header
    cells.</li>

    <li><b>.ReportTableValueCell</b>: This class is applied to table data
    cells.</li>

    <li><b>.ReportTableInfo</b>: This class is applied to table
    footnotes.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When generating reports in XML format, you can opt to output plain XML,
  XML linked to an external XSL stylesheet, or to process the XML using an
  external stylesheet and save the resulting output. This allows complete
  flexibility to format reports in any way.</p>

  <p>The default <a href="default-xsl.html">XSL stylesheet</a> used to render
  XHTML output can be used as a starting point for your own, and sample
  <a href="sample-xml.html">XML data</a> may also be reviewed if
  required.</p>
