* **Font** - This option allows you to select the font used in
  as standard font throughout pgAdmin. This may be useful for
  countries with multibyte character sets where standard fonts may not
  display well, or if you want to use a font different from the one
  configured on your system. 

* **Read and write Unicode UTF-8 files** - Select this option
   to enable pgAdmin if you want to write Unicode UTF-8 files by
   default.
  
* **Do not prompt for unsaved files on exit** - Selecting this option 
   will prevent pgAdmin from prompting you to save SQL queries upon
   exit.

* **Confirm object deletion** - Select this option to ensure pgAdmin 
   gives you a chance to confirm before objects are deleted
   (recommended). 
  
* **Show users for privileges** - When viewing the Privileges tab on 
   objects that support them, selecting this option will include usernames as 
   well as groups in the subject list. Switching off this option is useful on 
   large systems with many users that are organised in groups.

* **Show object properties on double click in treeview** - Selecting 
   this option will allow double clicking of objects in the treeview
   to open the Properties dialogue for that object. Some users prefer
   to disable this option to browse the treeview by double clicking
   instead. 
     
* **Do not show guru hints; I'm one myself** - pgAdmin III pops up
   hint windows from time to time, if it thinks you might need some support. If you feel
   annoyed by this and want to suppress this behaviour, you can check this box. 

* **Reset guru hints** - When a guru hint is displayed, you may have selected to suppress
   it to be shown in the future. If you want the hint to reappear, check this box.
