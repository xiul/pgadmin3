  <title>pgAgent Installation</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h3>pgAgent Installation</h3>

  <p>pgAgent runs as a daemon on *nix systems, and a service on Windows
  systems. In the majority of cases it will run on the database server itself
  - it is for this reason that pgAgent is not automatically setup when
  pgAdmin is installed. In some cases however, it may be preferable to run
  pgAgent on multiple systems, against the same database - individual jobs
  may be targetted at a particular host, or left for execution by any host.
  Locking prevents execution of the same instance of a job by multiple
  hosts.</p>

  <h3>Database setup</h3>

  <p>pgAgent stores its configuration in the "postgres" database in your
  cluster. This database exists by default in PostgreSQL 8.1 versions, for
  earlier versions you need to create the database yourself. The database
  must have the pl/pgsql procedural language installed - PostgreSQL's
  'createlang' program can do this if required.</p>

  <p>Connect to the "postgres" database (once created if needed), and open
  the SQL tool. Select the File -&gt; Open option from the menu and find the
  'pgagent.sql' script installed with pgAdmin. The installation location for
  this file varies from operating system to operating system, however it will
  normally be found under 'C:\Program files\pgAdmin III' on Windows systems
  (or 'C:\Program files\PostgreSQL\8.x\pgAdmin III' if installed with the
  PostgreSQL server installer), or '/usr/local/pgadmin3/share/pgadmin3' or
  '/usr/share/pgadmin3' on *nix systems. Once the file is loaded, click the
  'Run' button to execute the script.</p>

  <p>The script will create a number of tables and other objects in a schema
  called 'pgagent'.</p>

  <h3>Daemon installation on *nix</h3>

  <p>To install the pgAgent daemon on a *nix system, you will normally need
  to have root privileges to modify the system startup scripts - doing so is
  quite system specific so you should consult your system documentation for
  further information.</p>

  <p>The program itself takes few command line options - most of which are
  only needed for debugging or specialised configurations:</p>
  <pre>
Usage:
  /path/to/pgagent [options] &lt;connect-string&gt;
  
options:
  -f run in the foreground (do not detach from the terminal)
  -t &lt;poll time interval in seconds (default 10)&gt;
  -r &lt;retry period after connection abort in seconds (&gt;=10, default 30)&gt;
  -s &lt;log file (messages are logged to STDOUT if not specified)&gt;
  -l &lt;logging verbosity (ERROR=0, WARNING=1, DEBUG=2, default 0)&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The connect string required is a standard PostgreSQL libpq connection
  string (see the <a href=
  "http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq.html#libpq-connect">PostgreSQL
  documentation</a> for further details). For example, the following command
  lilne will run pgAgent against a server listening on the localhost, using a
  database called 'pgadmin', connecting as the user 'postgres':</p>
  <pre>
/path/to/pgagent hostaddr=127.0.0.1 dbname=postgres user=postgres
</pre>

  <h3>Service installation on Windows</h3>

  <p>pgAgent is able to self-install itself as a service on Windows systems.
  The command line options available are similar to those on *nix systems,
  but include an additional parameter to tell the service what to do:</p>
  <pre>
Usage:
  pgAgent REMOVE &lt;serviceName&gt;
  pgAgent INSTALL &lt;serviceName&gt; [options] &lt;connect-string&gt;
  pgAgent DEBUG [options] &lt;connect-string&gt;

  options:
    -u &lt;user or DOMAIN\user&gt;
    -p &lt;password&gt;
    -d &lt;displayname&gt;
    -t &lt;poll time interval in seconds (default 10)&gt;
    -r &lt;retry period after connection abort in seconds (&gt;=10, default 30)&gt;
    -l &lt;logging verbosity (ERROR=0, WARNING=1, DEBUG=2, default 0)&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The service may be quite simply installed from the command line as
  follows (adjusting the path as required):</p>
  <pre>
"C:\Program Files\pgAdmin III\pgAgent" INSTALL pgAgent -u postgres -p secret hostaddr=127.0.0.1 dbname=postgres user=postgres
</pre>

  <p>The service may then be started from the command line using <i>net start
  pgAgent</i>, or from the <i>Services</i> control panel applet. Any logging
  output or errors will be reported in the Application event log. The DEBUG
  mode may be used to run pgAgent from a command prompt. When run this way,
  log messages will output to the command window.</p>

  <h3>Security concerns</h3>

  <p>pgAgent is a very powerful tool, but does have some security
  considerations that you should be aware of:</p>

  <p><b>Database password</b> - <i>DO NOT</i> be tempted to include a
  password in the pgAgent connection string - on *nix systems it may be
  visible to all users in 'ps' output, and on Windows systems it will be
  stored in the registry in plain text. Instead, use a libpq <i>~/.pgpass</i>
  file to store the passwords for every database that pgAgent must access.
  Details of this technique may be found in the <a href=
  "http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgpass.html">PostgreSQL
  documentation</a>.</p>

  <p><b>System/database access</b> - all jobs run by pgAgent will run with
  the security privileges of the pgAgent user. SQL steps will run as the user
  that pgAgent connects to the database as, and batch/shell scripts will run
  as the operating system user that the pgAgent service or daemon is running
  under. Because of this, it is essential to maintain control over the users
  that are able to create and modify jobs. By default, only the user that
  created the pgAgent database objects will be able to do this - this will
  normally be the PostgreSQL superuser.</p>
