**Show System Objects in the treeview** - this option allows objects
such as system schemas (e.g. pg_temp*) and system columns (e.g. xmin,
ctid) to be included or excluded in the browser tree.

The list of check boxes is used to select which object types to show in the
browser tree. By default, only the most commonly used object types are
shown. Reducing the number of object types shown can increase the speed
of pgAdmin when querying the system catalogs. Use the **Default** button
to reset the list to its default settings.
