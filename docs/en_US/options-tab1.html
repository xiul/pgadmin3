  <ul>
    <li><b>User language</b> - This option allows you to change the language
    used in the pgAdmin user interface.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><b>PG help path</b> - This option is used to specify the path to the
    PostgreSQL help files. This may be a URL or directory containing the HTML
    format help files (note that some browsers may require
    file:///path/to/local/files/ notation, whilst others require
    /path/to/local/files/ notation), or the path to a Compiled HTML Help
    (.chm) file (on Windows), an HTML Help project (.hhp) file, or a Zip
    archive containing the HTML files and the HTML Help project file. The
    PostgreSQL Help is used when selected from the Help menu, or when working
    with many database objects on PostgreSQL servers.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><b>EDB help path</b> - This option is used to specify the path to the
    EnterpriseDB help files, and may be configured in the same way as the PG
    help path. The EnterpriseDB Help is used when selected from the Help
    menu, or when working with many database objects on EnterpriseDB
    servers.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><b>GP help path</b> - This option is used to specify the path to the
    Greenplum help files, and may be configured in the same way as the PG
    help path. The Greenplum Help is used when selected from the Help menu,
    or when working with many database objects on Greenplum servers.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><b>Slony help path</b> - This option is used to specify the path to
    the Slony help files, and may be configured in the same way as the PG
    help path. The Slony Help is used when selected from the Help menu.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><b>System schemas</b> - You can suppress the display of additional
    schemas, by declaring them a system schema. This field takes a list of
    comma separated strings.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><b>Slony-I path</b> - To enable pgAdmin III to create Slony-I
    replication clusters from scratch, you need to enter the path to the
    Slony-I script installation directory here. If no valid scripts can be
    found, only joining existing clusters is possible.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><b>PG bin path</b> - This should be set to the path to the standard
    PostgreSQL pg_dump, pg_restore and pg_dumpall utilities. pgAdmin will use
    these for backing up and restoring your PostgreSQL databases. If this
    path is not set, pgAdmin will attempt to find the utilities in its
    installation directory, the 'hint' directory set by a local PostgreSQL
    installation (on Windows) and in the system path.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><b>EDB bin path</b> - This should be set to the path to the
    EnterpriseDB pg_dump, pg_restore and pg_dumpall utilities. pgAdmin will
    use these for backing up and restoring your EnterpriseDB databases. If
    this path is not set, pgAdmin will attempt to find the utilities in
    standard locations used by EnterpriseDB.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><b>GP bin path</b> - This should be set to the path to the Greenplum
    pg_dump, pg_restore and pg_dumpall utilities. pgAdmin will use these for
    backing up and restoring your Greenplum databases. If this path is not
    set, pgAdmin will attempt to find the utilities in standard locations
    used by Greenplum.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><b>Ignore server/utility version mismatches</b> - When checked,
    pgAdmin will pass the '-i' option to utilities such as <i>pg_dump</i>
    which will allow utilities from one version of the database to be used
    with another version. This option should be use with extreme care as it
    may cause errors to occur during backup or restore options.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
