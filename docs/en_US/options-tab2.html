  <ul>
    <li><b>Font</b> - This option allows you to select the font used in as
    standard font throughout pgAdmin. This may be useful for countries with
    multibyte character sets where standard fonts may not display well, or if
    you want to use a font different from the one configured on your
    system.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><b>Read and write Unicode UTF-8 files</b> - Select this option to
    enable pgAdmin if you want to write Unicode UTF-8 files by default.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><b>Do not prompt for unsaved files on exit</b> - Selecting this
    option will prevent pgAdmin from prompting you to save SQL queries upon
    exit.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><b>Confirm object deletion</b> - Select this option to ensure pgAdmin
    gives you a chance to confirm before objects are deleted
    (recommended).<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><b>Show users for privileges</b> - When viewing the Privileges tab on
    objects that support them, selecting this option will include usernames
    as well as groups in the subject list. Switching off this option is
    useful on large systems with many users that are organised in groups.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><b>Show object properties on double click in treeview</b> - Selecting
    this option will allow double clicking of objects in the treeview to open
    the Properties dialogue for that object. Some users prefer to disable
    this option to browse the treeview by double clicking instead.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><b>Do not show guru hints; I'm one myself</b> - pgAdmin III pops up
    hint windows from time to time, if it thinks you might need some support.
    If you feel annoyed by this and want to suppress this behaviour, you can
    check this box.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><b>Reset guru hints</b> - When a guru hint is displayed, you may have
    selected to suppress it to be shown in the future. If you want the hint
    to reappear, check this box.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
