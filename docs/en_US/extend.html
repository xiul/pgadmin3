  <h3>Extended features</h3>

  <p>pgAdmin III's functionality can be further enhanced using the
  <i>adminpack</i> contrib module for PostgreSQL. This is a library of
  additional functions that may be installed on your server which allows
  pgAdmin to offer additional features, such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The sizes on disk of tablespaces, databases, tables and indexes are
    displayed on the Statistics tab in the <a href="main.html">main
    window</a>.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li>The <a href="status.html">Status dialogue</a> should be able to
    display the server logfiles (if logging is appropriately configured).<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li>Running queries from other users may be cancelled from the <a href=
    "status.html">Status dialogue</a>.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li>The server's configuration files postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf may
    be editted, and reloaded remotely.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The adminpack is installed and activated by default if you are running
  the 'official' pgInstaller distribution of PostgreSQL for Windows and is
  included as a contrib module with all versions of PostgreSQL 8.2 and above.
  However, if you are running any other version of PostgreSQL you will need
  to manually install it. To do so, simply copy the appropriate adminpack
  source code to the /contrib directory of your pre-configured PostgreSQL
  source tree. You can download the adminpacks <a href=
  "http://www.pgadmin.org/download/adminpacks.php">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Run the following commands (substituting <i>admin</i> for <i>admin81</i>
  if required):</p>
  <pre>
    # cd $PGSRC/contrib/admin
    # make all
    # make install
</pre>

  <p>The module should now be built, and installed into your existing
  PostgreSQL installation. To be used, you must now install the module into
  the database you use as pgAdmin's <i>Maintenance DB</i> (normally
  <i>postgres</i>, though you may wish to use a different database). To do
  so, locate the <i>admin.sql</i> or <i>admin81.sql</i> file installed in the
  previous step - normally this may be found in
  /usr/local/pgsql/share/contrib/ and run it against your database. You will
  normally need to do this as the PostgreSQL superuser:</p>
  <pre>
    $ psql postgres &lt; /usr/local/pgsql/share/contrib/admin.sql
</pre>

  <p>The next time you connect to the server with pgAdmin, it will detect the
  presence of the adminpack and offer full functionality.</p>

  <p>Since PostgreSQL 9.1, you don't need to use psql. You can manually add
  adminpack extension or make pgAdmin do the same by clicking on the "Fix
  It!" button of the guru hint.</p>
