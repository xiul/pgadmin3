  <h3>Slony-I tasks</h3>

  <p>In the appropriate context, pgAdmin III can trigger several maintenance
  tasks.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><b id="restart">Restart node</b> - Under some conditions, it may be
      necessary to restart a slon process on a node, initialize as if freshly
      started and make it reload its configuration. This can be triggered
      remotely with the restart node function.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><b id="lock">Lock set</b> - Disables updates to a set to be
      replicated. This is necessary for clean switch over the source of a
      replication from one node to another.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><b id="unlock">Unlock set</b> - Re-enables updates to a set to be
      replicated after a previous lock.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><b id="merge">Merge set</b> - Joins two sets, originating from the
      same node and subscribed by the same nodes, into one. This can be used
      as a workaround to the fact that a subscribed set can't be
      extended.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><b id="move">Move set</b> - Moves a replication set from one node to
      another, i.e. making the target node the new source. The old node will
      become subscriber to the new provider node. This is the normal way how
      to switch over gracefully the master role from one node to another.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
