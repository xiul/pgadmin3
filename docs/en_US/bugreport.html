  <h3>Bug Reporting</h3>

  <p>If you think you encountered a bug in pgAdmin III, please check the
  following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Is this behaviour expected? Have a look at the <a href=
    "http://www.pgadmin.org/pgadmin3/faq/">FAQs</a>.</li>

    <li>Is this bug already reported? Check the <a href=
    "http://www.pgadmin.org/pgadmin3/bugs.php">known bugs</a>.</li>

    <li>Are you running the latest version from the <a href=
    "http://www.pgadmin.org/snapshots">beta website</a>? If not, try the
    newest stuff.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Ahh, so you've found a new one then?</p>

  <p>Post your report to the <a href=
  "http://archives.postgresql.org/pgadmin-support/">support mailing list</a>,
  and include the following informations:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Platform you're running on</li>

    <li>Language</li>

    <li>Distribution you used (source tarball, or binary)</li>

    <li>Version you tested</li>

    <li>If possible and appropriate, include a backtrace from the crash. You
    may need to recompile wxWidgets and pgAdmin with the --enable-debug
    option to do this.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please do <b>not</b> send an email directly to one of the programmers;
  they might miss it, or even be the wrong person altogether. Using the
  mailing list guarantees that your request isn't lost and will be answered
  in a timely fashion.</p>

  <p>After a bug has been reported on the mailing list as being fixed, it
  might take one or two days until it has made it into the distribution
  tarballs, please be patient.</p>

  <p>Thanks for giving pgAdmin3 a chance!</p>

  <p>The pgAdmin Development Team</p>
