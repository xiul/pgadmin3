  <h3>pgAgent Steps</h3>

  <p>Each Job consists of a number of steps, each of which may be an SQL
  script, or an operating system batch/shell script. Each step in a given job
  is run in turn, in alphanumeric name order.</p>

  <p>Steps may be added to a job through the job properties dialogue, or
  added as a sub-object. The <i>Properties</i> tab of the main pgAdmin window
  will display details of the selected step, and the <i>Statistics</i> tab
  will display details of each run of the step, including and output or
  errors from the script.</p>

  <p>Each step consists of the details shown on the screenshot below, most of
  which are self-explanatory. If <i>Kind</i> is set to SQL, then it goes
  without saying that a database against which to run the script must be
  selected. If set to <i>Batch</i>, the database/connection string should be
  left blank. The <i>On Error</i> option controls how failure of this step
  will affect the status of the overall job.</p>

  <p>The <i>Definition</i> tab contains a single text box into which the step
  script should be entered. For SQL steps, this should be a series of one or
  more SQL statements. For batch jobs, when running on a Windows server,
  standard batch file syntax must be used, and when running on a *nix server,
  any shell script may be used, provided that a suitable interpreter is
  specified on the first line (e.g. <i>#!/bin/sh</i>).</p>
