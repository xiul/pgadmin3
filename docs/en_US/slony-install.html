  <h3>Slony-I administration with pgAdmin III: installation</h3><br>

  <h4>Prerequisites</h4>

  <p>As a prerequisite to running Slony-I on PostgreSQL, the slony modules
  xxid and slony1_funcs must be present on all servers that have to run a
  Slony-I replication node. This is usually done by the Slony-I installation
  routine.<a name="overview" id="overview"></a></p>

  <h4>Overview</h4>

  <p>Setting up Slony-I for the first time can be a daunting task. The
  following sections of the pgAdmin helpfile will help guide you through
  creation of your first cluster.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#create">Step 1</a>: Create the cluster on the master
    node.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><a href="#join">Step 2</a>: Add slave nodes to the cluster.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><a href="slony-path.html#path">Step 3</a>: Setup paths on each node
    to all other nodes.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><a href="slony-path.html#listen">Step 4</a>: Setup listens on each
    node to all other nodes (<b>Note</b>: Not required with Slony-I v1.1 or
    later).<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><a href="slony-set.html#set">Step 5</a>: Create a replication
    set.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><a href="slony-set.html#table">Step 6</a>: Add tables and sequences
    to the set.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li><a href="slony-set.html#subscription">Step 7</a>: Subscribe the
    slaves to the set.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Note</b>: At this point, the slon daemons (service engines on
  Windows) should be started.<br>

  <h4>Create cluster and first node</h4><br>

  <p>To install a Slony-I cluster on the first database, the "New Slony-I
  Cluster" dialog is used. It executes the official Slony-I cluster creation
  SQL scripts, which are located in the directory configured in the <a href=
  "options-tab1.html">options</a> dialog.</p>

  <p>pgAdmin III needs to store information how to contact each individual
  node in the cluster. To achieve this, pgAdmin III uses the concept of
  "Administrative nodes".<a name="join" id="join"></a></p>

  <h4>Join additional nodes to cluster</h4><br>

  <p>After the first node in the Slony-I replication cluster has been
  successfully created, all subsequent nodes take their configuration and
  procedures from the first nodes. This process is called "Joining a cluster"
  in pgAdmin III. Usually, you should also select an existing node as admin
  node, to insure later accessibility from pgAdmin III.After you added a new
  node to the Slony-I cluster, you need to set up <a href=
  '"slony-path.html'>replication paths</a> between the nodes, to enable
  communication between the nodes. <a name="upgrade" id="upgrade"></a></p>

  <h4>Upgrade node to new cluster software</h4><br>

  <center>
    <img src="images/slony-upgrade.png">
  </center>

  <p>When a cluster is to be upgraded to a new version of the Slony-I
  clustering software, the upgrade process has to be run on all nodes of the
  cluster. For each node, the slon daemon needs to be stopped, then the
  upgrade dialog is started and a node with the new software is selected
  (pgAdmin III will extract all software from that node), and finally the
  slon daemon is started again.</p>

  <p>Currently, pgAdmin III does <b>not</b> support upgrading from slony
  creation scripts. Instead, create an intermediate cluster from the creation
  scripts, use it as a source for the upgrade dialog, and drop the cluster
  after usage. You may also use the slonik tool to upgrade the first node,
  and then use it as source for subsequent node upgrades.</p>
