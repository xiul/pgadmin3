  <p>To change your password, follow the following steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Enter your current password in the <i>Current Password</i>
    textbox.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li>Enter your desired password in the <i>New Password</i> textbox.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li>Enter your desired password again, this time in the <i>Confirm
    Password</i> textbox.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li>Click the <i>OK</i> button.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Good Practice</h3>

  <p>It is good policy to set a password to protect your data, even in 'safe'
  environments such as at home. In the workplace, failure to apply an
  appropriate password policy could leave you in breach of Data Protection
  laws in some circumstances.</p>

  <p>pgAdmin does not enforce any password restrictions, however we do
  recommend that you consider the following guidelines when selecting
  passwords. This is not an exhaustive list and <b>will not guarantee
  security</b>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Ensure that passwords are of adequate length. 6 characters should be
    the absolute minimum.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li>Ensure that passwords are not easily guessable by others, or open to
    dictionary attacks. Use a mixture of upper and lower case letters and
    numerics, and avoid using words or names. Consider using the first letter
    from each word in a phrase that you will rememeber easily but others will
    not guess.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>

    <li>Ensure that your password is change regularly - at least every ninety
    days.</li>
  </ul>
