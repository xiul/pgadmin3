  <h3>Connect errors</h3>

  <p>When connecting to a PostgreSQL server, you might get error messages
  that need some more explanations. If you encounter them, please read the
  following information carefully, we're sure they will help you.<br></p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="hints/conn-listen.html">could not connect to Server:
    Connection refused</a></li>

    <li><a href="hints/conn-hba.html">FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry</a></li>
  </ul><br>

  <h3 id="notrunning">could not connect to Server: Connection refused</h3>

  </center>

  <p>If this message appears, there are two possible reasons for this: either
  the server isn't running at all. Simply start it.</p>

  <p>The other non-trivial cause for this message is that the server isn't
  configured to accept TCP/IP requests on the address shown.</p>

  <p>For security reasons, a PostgreSQL server "out of the box" doesn't
  listen on TCP/IP ports. Instead, it has to be enabled to listen for TCP/IP
  requests. This can be done by adding <b>tcpip = true</b> to the
  postgresql.conf file for Versions 7.3.x and 7.4.x, or
  <b>listen_addresses='*'</b> for Version 8.0.x and above; this will make the
  server accept connections on any IP interface.</p>

  about <a href=
  "http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/runtime-config.html">runtime
  configuration</a>.<br>

  <h3 id="no-hba">FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry</h3>

  <p>If this message appears, your server can be contacted correctly over the
  network, but isn't configured to accept your connection. Your client isn't
  detected as a legal user for the database.</p>

  <p>You will have to add an entry in the form<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>host template1 postgres 192.168.0.0/24 md5</b><br>
  for IPV4 or<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>host template1 postgres ::ffff:192.168.0.0/120
  md5</b><br>
  for IPV6 networks to the pg_hba.conf file.</p>
