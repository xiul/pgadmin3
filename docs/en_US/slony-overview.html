  <h3>Slony-I with pgAdmin III overview</h3>

  <p>The Slony-I objects are integrated into pgAdmin's main object tree
  browser, allowing a single interface to both database object and
  replication administration.</p>

  <p>The statistics tab for the nodes collection as well as for individual
  nodes show the status of the replication event queue, and allows monitoring
  of the functionality of the slony cluster.</p>

  <p>As an example, the situation shown above displays the status of a node
  that hasn't been responsive for about an hour, with 381 events pending to
  be replicated to that node.</p>
