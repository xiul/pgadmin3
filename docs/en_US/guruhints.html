  <h3>Guru Hints</h3>

  <p>pgAdmin III has some functions included which should help to implement
  healthy and good performing databases. They are the result of the long
  experience of the developers worldwide, and the design problems commonly
  observed.</p>

  <p>If pgAdmin III thinks it has a valuable hint for you, it will pop up a
  guru hint unless you have chosen to suppress that individual hint or all
  hints (see <a href='options-tab2.html'>options</a>). You can bring up the
  hint by pressing the hint button in the toolbar at any time, if
  enabled.</p>

  <p>This is an example of a guru hint, as it appears when trying to connect
  to a non-running or misconfigured PostgreSQL server.</p>

  <p>If you check 'do not show this hint again', the automatic popup of the
  individual hint will be suppressed in the future, until it is reset in the
  <a href='options-tab2.html'>options</a>. Error messages will still appear,
  but without the extended information as provided by the hints.</p>
