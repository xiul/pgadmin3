  <h3>pgAdmin Main Window</h3>

  <center>
    <img src="images/main.png">
  </center>

  <p>In the main window, the structure of the databases is displayed. You can
  create new objects, delete and edit existing objects if the privileges of
  the user that you are using on the current connection to the database allow
  this.</p>

  <p>The left side of the main window shows a tree with all servers, and the
  objects they contain.</p>

  <p>The upper right side shows details of the object currently selected in
  the tree. Some objects might have statistics in addition to their
  properties, these can be shown if you select the Statistics tab.</p>

  <p>The lower right side contains a reverse engineered SQL script. You can
  copy this to any editor using cut&amp;paste, or save it to a file using
  Save definition... from the File menu, or use it as a template if you
  select the <a href="query.html">Query Tool</a>. If the <a href=
  "options-tab4.html">Copy SQL from main window to query tool</a> option is
  selected, the SQL query will be copied automatically to the tool.</p>

  <p>The status line will show you some status information, as well as the
  time the last action took pgAdmin III to complete.</p>

  <p>You can resize the main window, and change the sizes of the three main
  regions as you prefer. These adjustments will be preserved when you exit
  the program.</p>

  <p>pgAdmin is bandwidth friendly. The status of objects in the browser is
  only refreshed on request or after changes made with the built-in tools. Be
  aware that this does not cover changes made via manual SQL or from other
  users or other clients. It is generally advisable to manually refresh
  objects before working on them in such environments.</p>

  <h3>Getting started</h3>

  <p>After you have added the desired server(s) to the tree on the left side
  using the <a href="connect.html">Add server</a> menu or toolbar button,
  each server will show up under the top node "Servers".</p>

  <p>To open a connection to a server, select the desired server in the tree,
  and double click on it or use Connect from the Tools menu. The connection
  will be established, and the properties of the top level objects are
  retrieved from the database server. If you've been connected to that
  database previously, pgAdmin III will restore the previous selection of
  database and schema for you. The current situation is saved when exiting
  the program, so that pgAdmin III is able to restore the previous
  environment.</p>

  <p>Using the menu or toolbar buttons, you can create new objects, delete
  objects and edit properties of existing objects if the user that you
  entered when adding the server connection has sufficient privileges. You
  may find some options grayed out if displaying properties. This means, that
  the database server you're currently using doesn't support the feature, or
  that this property can't be changed by design, or that your user privileges
  won't allow you to change it.</p>
