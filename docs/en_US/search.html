  <p>With this dialog, you can search for almost any kind of objects in a
  database.</p>

  <p>You can access it by right clicking a database and select "Search
  objects" or by hitting CTRL-G. The minimum pattern length are 3 characters
  except for operators. The search performed is non-case sensitive and will
  find all objets whose name contains the pattern. You can only search for
  object names.</p>

  <p>The result is presented in the grid with object type, object name and
  the object tree path. You can click on a result row to select the object in
  the <a href="main.html">browser</a>. If the object is grey, this means that
  you don't have enabled those object types in the <a href=
  "options-tab3.html">Browser settings</a> (third tab of the Options dialog),
  so you can't click on it.</p>
