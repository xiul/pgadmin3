  <h3>Creating sets and subscriptions</h3><a name="set" id="set"></a>

  <h4>Create replication set</h4><br>

  <p>Slony-I groups tables and sequences it has to replicate from a master to
  slaves into replication sets. The set is created on the source node of the
  data.<a name="table" id="table"></a></p>

  <h4>Define replicated table</h4><br>

  </center>

  <p>If the source table has triggers defined on it, these have to be
  disabled on replication target nodes. But in replication environments, the
  master and slave roles might exchange, so it is necessary to enable and
  disable triggers in those situations. The 'Trigger' page allows selection
  of triggers that Slony-I should enable and disable if necessary.</p>

  <p><b>Attention</b>: If a table you'd like to have replicated doesn't
  appear in the table combobox, this usually means that the table lacks a
  unique index. Slony-I requires that each row in tables that are to be
  replicated must be uniquely identifyable. Usually, this should be done with
  a primary key, but for replication purposes a unique key is
  satisfactory.</p>

  <p>While Slony-I has a helper function to define intermediate unique keys,
  this is not supported with tables added to replication sets with pgAdmin
  III. We strongly recommend defining a primary key on the tables to be
  replicated.<a name="sequence" id="sequence"></a></p>

  <h4>Define replicated sequence</h4><br>

  <center>
    <img src="images/slony-sequence.png">

  <p>The sequence allows adding sequences to a replication set.<a name=
  "subscription" id="subscription"></a></p>

  <h4>Subscribe a replication set</h4><br>

  <center>

  </center>

  <p>After a replication set has been defined, it can be subscribed.
  Subscriptions have to be created on the source node (note: on Slony-1
  before v1.1, this had to be performed on the target node).</p>

  <p>After a set has been subscribed, its table and sequence definition can't
  be changed any more. To add more tables, you can create a set that includes
  the additional tables and sequences you'd like to have added to the first
  replication set, then subscribe exactly the same receiver nodes to it, and
  finally use <a href="slony-functions.html#merge">Merge</a> to merge both
  sets into one.</p>
